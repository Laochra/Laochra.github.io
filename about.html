				<h3 style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0;">Growing Up</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					From the moment I got my hands on my first game (Asteroids for the original Playstation), I knew games were something special.
					This feeling only strengthened as I discoved more and more games and loved coming up with new ideas for them, and dreaming about what it would be like to make them.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0;">My Path to Game Dev</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					In 2016 I made my first ever game project, as part of a student GameMaker competition, and ever since I've been developing my skills with design and coding, and making little projects for fun.
					<br><br>
					In 2018 I studied at AIE learning about art, design, and code and that experience really helped me find what I enjoyed doing in games.
					From 2022 to 2023 I further studied design and decided to make the leap to programming and solidified my passion as a programmer with an eye for design.
					In 2024 I respecialised my study in programming.
				</p>

				<h3 style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0;">Personal Hobbies</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
					To this day I still love to participate in game jams and small projects just for fun, but even when I'm not I'm usually doing something creative.
					I love world-building, tabletop systems design, creating fun and interesting characters and madeup mystical species, and drawing.
				</p>

				<h3>As a Game Developer</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					I have a passion for games from both a design and technical perspective. I love learning about new skills, techniques,
					and methodologies, and always like to take something from every new experience. Many of the projects on my portfolio
					exist because of pushing myself to learn new things and going outside my comfort zone. The biggest of which was undertaking
					the development of a custom engine as a way to improve my tool programming skills, and learn how graphics works.
				</p>
				<h3>Going Forward</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					I've worked out I want to specialise more into gameplay systems, and tools programming, as I really enjoy the creativity they
					require when working within constraints. I love working with people of varied disciplines and being able to deliver
					something that will benefit the team and/or the game being made. I'd love the opportunity to work within a custom engine
					again, but am equally comfortable using Unity, or learning another off the shelf C++ / C# engine.
