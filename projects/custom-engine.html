				<h3>Mycelia Game Engine</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					Given the length of time I spent working on this project (around a year as of December 2024),
					its goal has shifted a bit. The first and foremost goal though was to have an opportunity to
					progress my skills in tools programming, learn and get experience with graphics, and to discover
					how different aspects of a game engine come together. As the project progressed though I hoped for
					an opportunity to use it to make a game with a team, and worked on making the experience as good
					as possible for that goal.

				<h1>The Requirements</h1>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					I had no idea what type of game this engine would be used for. I was hoping for it to be used
					for a 5 month group student capstone project, but I wouldn't know what type of game would be made
					in it until that project started, if I was even able to get things to a state where people would
					be comfortable using the engine for that. So the things I prioritised were core features that would
					be useful for most if not all games.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					<a href="https://learnopengl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

					was an extremely helpful resource when it came to learning about graphics and getting started
					implementing the rendering for my engine, right up till getting PBR implemented. Once I was working on
					getting PBR implemented I found
					<a href="https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/course_notes_moving_frostbite_to_pbr_v32.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						this really helpful document made by Frostbite
					</a>,
					on how they transitioned their engine to PBR, and it was super informative on the history and different ways of
					implementing the techniques.

				<p>
					Of all the general graphics features I implemented, PBR was one of the hardest. Not to write the shader code,
					but to understand what was going on. I generally like to understand what I'm doing and this posed a bit of a
					challenge for me. Through some research and time spent with the resources at my disposal I feel I was able to
					come to an understanding of roughly how it works, and I definitely understand how to use it. I learned I needed
					to be comfortable with not understanding the equations fully though.

				<h3>Busharium</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					This game was made by a team of 6, with me as the sole programmer. We also had Alicia Hayashi and Blake Andrews as
					designers, Phoenix Marsh and Pierce Siddans as artists, and Isabella Verduci as composer. The game was developed over
					the course of 5 months and made within my engine.

			<div class="Profile" id="WideProfile">
				<h1 style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0;">Feedback on Using My Engine</h1>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					After the conclusion of the Busharium game project, I asked my team members if they'd be willing to
					be interviewed on their thoughts, feelings, and takeaways from working in my engine.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The Positives</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					A common theme in the feedback was that the engine was easy to use, simple to navigate, and wasn't bogged down in bloat.
					This can be attributed to the tooling really all being built for purpose, and the team was really positive about that.
					I recieved a lot of positive feedback on how well I communicated, and how easy it was to talk through how possible it would
					be for me to implement certain things. A funny point mentioned was how quick the load times are compared to Unity, since here
					they're relatively instant compared to about 6 minutes for Unity. It was also appreciated how quickly I was able to tend to bugs,
					including the occassional crashes early in the project, and how helpful it was that I was there to ask questions at any time.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The Things to Improve</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					The biggest sore point was the lack of ability for designers to rapidly prototype ideas in engine. They managed to make
					do with paper prototypes and the game we were making lended itself well to that, but it was noticed that without scripting support
					for the designers, there was a limited amount of prototyping that could occur, since I'd be the one doing it all. It was mentioned
					that it would be good to have an in-engine filesystem to use instead of always opening up the built-in windows one, as well as having
					engine-specific filetype icons, and thats something I can certainly look into. Another key point was the fact there wasn't a lot of
					documentation. Since a lot of things the team were using was specific to the game, and it was a small team I figured I could get away
					with not much written documentation. I think that was a bit of a mistake, and although it didn't hurt this project, its certainly
					something I will improve on for the future.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The Takeaways</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					The team was generally really happy to have had the opportunity to work within a custom engine. Even with some of the drawbacks,
					they mention being glad to have had the experience. The team kept coming back to how simple and nice it was to work in something
					where all of the tools have a purpose that they can utilise, and not need to worry about things that aren't there for them.
					Alicia in particular mentioned how interesting it was for her being able to ask and discuss how I implemented different things,
					and getting to see things built up for the team. The team definitely realised and felt how much effort I put into communicating with
					them on their needs, and working together to see what I could do to support them.
