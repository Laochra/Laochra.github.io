				<h3>Busharium Trailer</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					Busharium is a cosy environment builder game that utilises a hex grid. It has a stylised art direction,
					invoking Australian watercolour and Ken Sugimori's original Pokemon concepts. It also heavily draws
					inspiration from Australian flora and fauna.
					<br><br>
					This project was worked on by a team over 5 months, and I was the sole programmer. My responsibilities
					involved all of the gameplay code, engine code, and all of the tooling that the team would need to make this game.

				<h1>The Requirements</h1>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					As the only programmer on this project (and the one writing the engine) a lot of my own choices would have implicit effects
					on others in the project, and that was not a responsibility I took lightly. I ended up taking on a backend role in a big way,
					spending a good 60-70% of my time working on tooling to support the other team members. This would involve a comprehensive
					art importer for debugging and setting up assets, data oriented systems allowing designers to set up as much as possible
					without me needing to alter code, and a way to interface with everything that wouldn't become a burden for those using the tooling.

				<h3>"Hex Editor"</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					So much of the game's logic revolved around the connectivity of different assets. What tiles are used
					for which habitat, which sprites represent which collected habitat (objective), and which audio file
					plays when. The code at no point has any knowledge of any of these assets, and so it has a json file that
					points it to the assets, but also defines many of the game's important variables. Designers were able to
					completely modify milestone thresholds, how many habitats existed, where UI elements would be placed on the
					screen and more. Many of the selections within this editor window are aware of data from other sections,
					for example: the dropdowns for which tiles make up a habitat reflect which tiles have been defined by the designer.

				<h3>Art Importer</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					The engine's art importer was revamped for this game, to support the needs of the artists. The goal of
					the art importer is to preview how an asset looks before commiting to it. Artists could see the assets in
					the lighting of the game, manipulate the camera settings, and apply materials, all before importing it. Then
					once the artist was ready they could click the 'cook' button, and all the mesh files would be converted to
					an internal format and connected via a prefab, with the applied materials saved. The revamping of the art
					importer was guided by the needs of the artists on this project.

				<h3>Art Style References</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					The goal the artists had was for any frame of the game to look like a watercolour painting,
					drawing inspiration from Australian watercolour, and Ken Sugimori's original Pokemon concepts.
					So, with this in mind, I worked with them to ensure the rendering in the engine would support that.
					I tore out the PBR lighting equations and gave our tech artist, Phoenix Marsh, free reign (with support)
					to set up the lighting as they liked. They previously had experience setting up a 'toon shader' and
					so we collaborated to translate it into something that would look right for our game.

				<h3>Shadow Noise</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					Things didn't look quite right when having harsh cutoffs between highlights and shadows. This is
					a result of using a toon shader as the idea is to eliminate gradients. However, we wanted to emulate
					the less uniform, more expressive nature of paintings, where no brushstroke is exact, and drops of paint
					and texture result in uneven or splotchy lines. To do this I used a noise map seeded with the XZ position of
					each fragment in world space to offset the highlight values, and offset the shadowmaps. A side benefit of doing
					this is that it was able to mask the resolution of the shadowmap, making it look higher detail than we otherwise could.

				<h3>Hexagonal Fog</h3>
				<br>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					We needed a way to present the boundary of play to the player, and we wanted it to be something dynamic and in-world
					as it would expand as the player progressed. For this I developed what I believe to be a new technique for generating
					a fog map that aligns to a hex grid.

				<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					Over the project I frequently set up different feature branches that would be commited to regularly.
					As I was the only programmer I didn't have as much time to set up tests for everything, but I did have a
					designer on the team, Alicia Hayashi, who was able to run daily smoke tests for me before integrating to main.
					Due to the short playtime of our game (3-5mins), we decided it was reasonable to set it up that way.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Continuous Delivery</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					I had a build script set up that built out both the editor version and standalone version of the game.
					And on top of this, assets would be cooked down on import so we didn't need to include it in the build pipeline.
					This resulted in always having a working version of the game to play, and very quick turn around for making
					changes and seeing them reflected in game.
					<br><br>
					For deployments I had Butler set up, which is a command line tool for itch.io that allows you to easily upload
					new versions while only modifying changed files to reduce upload time.

				<h1 style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0;">Post Mortem</h1>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					I was the sole programmer on this project, and I also programmed the engine used for
					it. I spent my time balancing working on tooling for the other team members and
					working on gameplay code. I feel I was able to be a useful member of the team by
					communicating thoroughly, holding myself to a high standard, and dedicating myself to
					the project. I feel really happy with how the project turned out and I'm so proud of
					the amazing work each of the members of my team put in.

					<i>Design Lead & QA</i>
					<br>
					Alicia worked tirelessly on the project. It was easy to see how dedicated she was to
					what she was doing, and she proved time and again how she could soar when the
					opportunity presented. She handled the challenges of being Design Lead in stride and
					was a big force in the game being as polished as it ended up. She was never afraid to
					get her hands dirty in engine and set things up, smash out a bunch of UI, or prototype
					with pen and paper.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					<i>Producer, Designer, & Sound Support</i>
					<br>
					Blake was a fantastic producer. His management of the project and us as a time, while
					fairly loose, was very appreciated. He always made sure everyone’s voices were being
					heard, and took everyone’s needs seriously. On top of that he showed off a range of
					design skills and worked really well with Alicia to ensure that the game was being
					received the way we intended and wasn’t bogged down by hitches.

				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					<i>Sound & Composition</i>
					<br>
					I didn't get to work as closely with Isabella since she worked remotely, but she put
					a ton of effort into the work she made. She came to us and worked with us through
					multiple revisions of sounds and the music, always looking to improve and share
					her talent. The final result of her assets came out really well and fit the game
					wonderfully, which was especially impressive given she joined the project halfway.

				<h3><a href="https://phoenix_marsh.artstation.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoenix Marsh</a></h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					<i>Environment & Tech Artist</i>
					<br>
					Phoenix killed it on pushing the game’s art style. Between their hard work on pre-
					visualisation, fine tuning shaders, and attention to detail with the tile assets, they really
					brought a sense of life to the game. They worked really well with Pierce to create a
					cohesive style, and assets to suit. Phoenix was prepared to learn new tools, request
					things they needed, and collaborate with any of the rest of us to improve the game.
				</p>
				<h3><a href="https://siddanspj.artstation.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierce Siddans</a></h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0;">
					<i>Environment & Character Artist</i>
					<br>
					Pierce did such an amazing job adding wonder to the game’s art. His habitat assets,
					and spirit assets are such a nice reward for the player to discover, and really evoke the
					sense of accomplishment and joy we’d hoped to encourage in players. He was
					incredibly communicative and was never afraid to speak up if he didn’t understand
					something. Pierce was an incredibly dedicated member of the team and project.
